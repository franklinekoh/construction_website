                <p>It Was to me a revelation from God many years back and it has caused me a lot of research effort, 
                    my computer had been object of several cyber-attacks , this is because of the information through I possess, 
                    during the cause of this period I wrote to the U.S embassy in Nigeria and I started receiving more information about the project. 
                    Almost all of Europe generates energy the from use of fossil fuel to use of municipal waste Energy in their countries and that is 
                    why Nigeria crude oil is no longer fashionable in the developed world. In recent times energy is rather generated from
                    sustainable means instead of fossil fuel that can be exhausted. The sources of this renewable form of energy as we all know are wind, solar, solid waste 
                    to mention but a few. They are other energy sources like dynamos. The developed world can suggest any technology
                    to third world or developing Nation even when such energy is detrimental to human health.
                      We have a duty to the world by reducing our carbon monoxide burning to avoid depletion of the ozone layer and converting all waste generated from petrochemical
                      product to carbon which can be managed effectively if they are buried underground. That is the role of our today project,
                      which when analyzed helps us to reduce all our waste to energy, reduce noise from all small 
                      generators around our homes and telecommunication facilities, banks and even 
                      hospitals to bigger and better managed Energy company of present day technology. Our organization want a situation where we
                      can convert as many renewable Energy mentioned earlier to sustainable means, for the growth and development of the society.

                    We want all our investors to be registered in a format of binary systems through a foreign data based management company,
                    each investor becoming a card carrying member with account for both receiving bonus and payments.
                    The money so generated is used to set up plants to generate 14 MEGA WATTS, 50 MEGA WATTS AND 75 MEGA WATTS 
                    plants according to the needs of the society, both on and off grid system. Off grid for cluster organization and on grid for states
                    with less concentration of industries.

                    My input into todays discussion shall be flowing from the river of my own personal experience as a technologist, industrialist and researcher
                 for over thirty years of experience and the holly spirit that works in man. Burning of fossil fuel, diesel in generators, petrol engines, 
                 open air burning refuse at our refuse dumps, open air tyre  burning, exhaust from trucks and mobile vehicles,
                 motorcycle and all small impellent using petrol and diesel, adds a lot of carbon monoxide to the atmosphere thereby contaminating it.We all can 
                 attest to climate
                 change we are currently experiencing in Nigeria, extended wet and dry season. This results into
                   excessive rainfall, causing flooding and causing destruction. We have to be developing other options,
                 if we are not going to face mass extinction from our own self disruptive human activities.
                Diseases are rapidly increasing and are traced to our human activities. Cancer is traced to human exposure to fossil fuel, carbon monoxide. 
                flooding is traced to human waste disposal and management, the usual
                throwing of waste in drainages and water ways, inside our  deep valley within the communities. What about water burn diseases traced
                to underground water pollutants.

                    We can not continue to do things the way we do it in time past and expect a new change as the government of today promised. 
                    So we have to create new ways of doing things to our own benefit.
                    To get more from our environment at very low or no cost.

                <p>
                    I recommend that we stop the importing and use of all mobile generators using fossil fuel 
                    which the federal government of Nigeria has being taking action to achieve and move quickly to other alternatives, i.e renew able energy.
                    The one that can preserve our life, prolong our living for a healthy and prosperous society.
